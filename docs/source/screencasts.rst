This section provides links to screencasts and videos that explain how to install gprMax, demonstrate some of its key features, and give example models showing applications.

Installation
------------

These screencasts are demonstrated on Microsoft Windows 7, but the installation and updating procedure is the same for other versions of Windows, and quite similar for Linux and macOS also. Detailed written installation and updating instructions are provided in the Getting Started section.
